       # Your JavaScript embed code, now accessible to 74.6 million users.

      Many WordPress users may find that pasting a `<script>` tag is too technical.
      WordPress plugins allow these non-technical users to use more tools with a few clicks.

      IWP wraps your embed code and creates a plugin that is ready for the WordPress Plugin Directory.
